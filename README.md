# Pneumonia_detection_system_dl
This project aims to develop an intelligent Pneumonia Detection System using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques to identify pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a potentially life-threatening infection that primarily affects the lungs. Early and accurate detection is crucial for timely treatment, especially in under-resourced medical environments.

Our system leverages computer vision models trained on labeled chest X-ray datasets to classify images into Pneumonia and Normal categories.
